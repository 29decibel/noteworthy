> Noteworthy is currently in development!  I work on Noteworthy in my free time, so progress comes in bursts.  I hope to have a public beta available for release before January 2021.


# Noteworthy ([https://noteworthy.ink/](https://noteworthy.ink/))

A free, open-source, local-first Markdown editor built with [ProseMirror](https://prosemirror.net/).

* Works directly with your **local** files, entirely **offline**.
* Write your notes in **Markdown**, plus a few optional extensions.
* Build your own personal wiki with **bidirectional links**.
* Excellent **math** support â€” seamlessly transition between source and rendered math, thanks to [KaTeX](https://katex.org/) and [prosemirror-math](https://github.com/benrbray/prosemirror-math).
